## Overview

The [_Mailbox Calculus_](publications.html#DeLiguoroPadovani18) – MC
for short – is a mild extension of the asynchronoys π-calculus that
can be used to model networks of processes that communicate through
*unordered* and *first-class* mailboxes. MC processes *selectively
receive* messages from mailboxes by means of their tag rather than
by their order of arrival. The Mailbox Calculus subsumes the *actor
model*.

MC is equipped with a behavioral typing discipline ensuring that
well-typed processes are *mailbox conformant* (no unexpected message
is ever received) and *deadlock free* (in a terminated process all
mailboxes are empty and there are no unperformed actions). The
_Mailbox Calculus Checker_ – MC² for short – is a tool to check
whether an MC process is well typed.

Below is an example of MC² script defining a lock shared by two
users. MC² determines that all the processes in the script are well
typed, implying that no lock is ever released when it is free and
that the system does not deadlock.

```
interface Lock { Acquire(User!), Release() }
interface User { Reply(Lock!) }

process Lock(self : Lock?) =
  case self ? *Acquire of
  { free ▸ done
  & Acquire(user) ▸
    { user!Reply(self)
    | case self ? Release·*Acquire of
      { Release ▸ Lock(self) } }
  & Release ▸ self?fail "free lock released" }

process User(self : User?, lock : Lock!) =
  { lock!Acquire(self)
  | case self ? Reply of
    { Reply(lock) ▸ lock!Release | self?free.done } }

process Main =
  new lock : Lock in
  new user₁ : User in
  new user₂ : User in
  { Lock(lock) | User(user₁, lock) | User(user₂, lock) }
```

## Installation Instructions

You need both [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) and
[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) to compile MC². Use of the
[Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (full version)
and [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) is recommended.

MC² also needs an external solver to decide the validity of
Presburger formulas. Currently, MC² can be configured to use either
[the LASH
toolset](http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~boigelot/research/lash)
(this is the default choice) or
[Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).  Configuring MC² for Z3 is
simpler and can be done using only official Cabal packages, but
requires nonetheless the installation of Z3 alongside MC².  Using
LASH requires some manual work (detailed below) but results in a
self-contained executable.  Also, LASH outperforms Z3 in processing
the Presburger formulas generated by MC².

Depending on the solver you choose, follow the instructions in the
corresponding section below before [compiling MC²][].

### Configuring MC² for LASH

1.  Download and unpack LASH in the same folder containing
    `README.md`, rename the top-level folder to `lash` and `cd` there:

    ```
    wget http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~boigelot/research/lash/releases/lash-v0.92.tar.gz
    tar xvfz lash-v0.92.tar.gz
    mv lash-v0.92 lash
    cd lash
    ```

2.  On 64-bit architectures it is necessary to patch LASH:

    ```
    patch -p1 <../lash64.diff
    ```

3.  Compile LASH, go back to the main folder and configure MC²:

    ```
    make
    cd ..
    cabal configure
    ```

### Configuring MC² for Z3

1.  Install Z3. The procedure varies depending on your OS and
    preferred package manager. On MacOS with
    [homebrew](http://brew.sh), for example, this is achieved
    issuing the command

    ```
    brew install z3
    ```

2.  Configure MC² specifying the `Z3` flag:

    ```
    cabal configure -fZ3
    ```

### Compiling MC²

1.  Compile MC²:

    ```
    cabal build
    ```

2.  Check whether the provided examples are type checked successfully:

    ```
    make check_examples
    ```

## Emacs mode

The MC² distribution includes an
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) mode that provides basic
syntax highlighting for MC processes. Add the line

```
(load "<path to>/mc.el")
```

to your `.emacs` initialization file.
