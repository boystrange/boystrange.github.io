I'm happy to serve as PC member for the *2<sup>nd</sup> workshop on
Verification of Session Types* ([VEST 2021]), organized by Ornela
Dardha and Ant√≥nio Ravara as an (online) satellite event of [ICALP
2021]. The [first edition](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/abcd/VEST/)
of the workshop was very successful and I'm sure this edition will
be just as good.
