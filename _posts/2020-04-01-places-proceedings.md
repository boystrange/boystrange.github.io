I'm chairing [PLACES 2020] together with [Stephanie Balzer]. The
proceedings of the workshop have been published and are [available
here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/content.cgi?PLACES2020).
Note that, due to the COVID-19 spread, [ETAPS
2020](https://etaps.org) has been postponed to some future date
which is not known yet at this time.
