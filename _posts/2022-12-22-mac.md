title:  "Setting up a new Mac"

{% include links.md %}

Every time I set up a new Mac computer I have to go through the
tiresome procedure of installing and configuring all the
applications I use, in addition to the Operating System itself. With
time I've collected the required steps in a log file, which is now
publicly available in [this GitHub
repository](https://github.com/boystrange/mac). Incidentally, the
repository also contains my Emacs, Vim, and Bash configuration
file. Feel free to have a look at the content of the repository,
clone and change it to fit your needs.
