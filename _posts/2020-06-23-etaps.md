Unfortunately [ETAPS 2020](https://etaps.org) is officially
cancelled and so is [PLACES 2020] as a consequence. It's a pity that
authors of accepted papers won't have the opportunity to present
their work at the workshop. There is a currently [open call for a
JLAMP Special Issue](https://tinyurl.com/yc6yaorg) dedicated to the
topics of the workshop.
