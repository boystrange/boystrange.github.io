{% include links.md %}

The paper [**Inference Systems with Corules for Fair Subtyping and
Liveness Properties of Binary Session Types**]({% link
publications.md %}#CicconePadovani21), written with Luca Ciccone,
has been accepted at the *48<sup>th</sup> International Colloquium
on Automata, Languages, and Programming* ([ICALP 2021]). In this
work we use [generalized inference
systems](https://github.com/LcicC/inference-systems-agda) to specify
combined safety and liveness properties of *dependent session types*
mixing induction and coinduction. All the results have been
formalized in Agda and are available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/boystrange/FairSubtypingAgda). Too bad
the conference will be online only.
