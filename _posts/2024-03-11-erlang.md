I'm excited to be a program committee member of [Erlang
2024](https://icfp24.sigplan.org/home/erlang-2024), the
23<sup>rd</sup> ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop that will be organized
as a co-located event affiliated with [ICFP
2024](https://icfp24.sigplan.org), and of [ICTCS
2024](https://ictcs2024.di.unito.it), the 25<sup>th</sup> Italian
Conference on Theoretical Computer Science. This year ICFP will be
held in Milan and ICTCS in Turin!
