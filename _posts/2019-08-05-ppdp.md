The paper [**Foundations of Session
Types**](publications.html#CastagnaDezaniGiachinoPadovani09), which
I coauthored with [Giuseppe Castagna], Mariangiola
Dezani-Ciancaglini and Elena Giachino back in 2009, has won the
[PPDP Most Influential Paper 10-Year
Award](http://ppdp2019.macs.hw.ac.uk/). We have written an
[abstract](publications.html#CastagnaDezaniGiachinoPadovani19) to
recollect how that work was born and what has happened in the
meantime.
