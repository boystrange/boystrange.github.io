The paper [**Foundations of Session
Types**](#CastagnaDezaniGiachinoPadovani09), which I coauthored with
[Giuseppe Castagna], Mariangiola Dezani-Ciancaglini and Elena
Giachino back in 2009, has won the [PPDP Most Influential Paper
10-Year Award](http://ppdp2019.macs.hw.ac.uk/). We have written an
[abstract](#CastagnaDezaniGiachinoPadovani19) to recollect how that
work was born and what has happened in the meantime.
