title:  "Back to Bologna!"
---

I have joined the <a href="https://disi.unibo.it/">Department of
Computer Science and Engineering</a> of the <a
href="https://www.unibo.it/">University of Bologna</a>. It's both
humbling and exciting to be working at the University where I did my
studies and meeting all the great people who taught me computer
science.
