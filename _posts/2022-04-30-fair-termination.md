The paper [**Fair Termination of Multiparty
Sessions**](publications.html#CicconeDagninoPadovani22), written
with Luca Ciccone and Francesco Dagnino, has been accepted at the
*35<sup>th</sup> European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming*
([ECOOP 2022]). This is a follow up of [previous
work](publications.html#CicconePadovani22) in which we apply our
technique ensuring fair termination to multiparty sessions. In this
work we also present a new sound and complete characterization of
**fair subtyping** which is substantially simpler than previous ones
and does not require auxiliary definitions or the use of a
generalized inference system.
