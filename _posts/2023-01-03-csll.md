title:  "On the fair termination of client-server sessions"
---

{% include links.md %}

Client-server sessions are based on a variation of the traditional
interpretation of linear logic propositions as session types in
which non-linear channels are typed by coexponentials instead of the
usual exponentials. In [this
manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05457) I prove a fair
termination result for CSLL<sup>∞</sup>, a core calculus of
client-server sessions. Each well-typed CSLL<sup>∞</sup> process
corresponds to a proof in μMALL<sup>∞</sup>, the infinitary proof
theory of linear logic with least and greatest fixed points. Fair
termination in CSLL<sup>∞</sup> follows from cut elimination in
μMALL<sup>∞</sup>.
