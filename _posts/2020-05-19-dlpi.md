{% include links.md %}

This date marks the first public release of [DLπ], an Agda
formalization of the linear π-calculus with dependent pairs jointly
developed with Luca Ciccone. DLπ allows for the modeling of
data-dependent processes and protocols encompassing dependent
session types. Luca Ciccone will give a talk about DLπ at the
[VEST](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/abcd/VEST/) workshop.
