title: "A logical account of subtyping for session types"
---

{% include links.md %}

In this paper, my first collaboration with [Ross Horne], we study a
termination-preserving notion of subtyping for session types in a
logical setting, where session types are propositions of
μMALL<sup>∞</sup>, that is multiplicative/additive linear logic
extended with least and greatest fixed points. We are amused by how
simple it is to characterize subtyping in this logic! The paper has
been presented at the [PLACES 2023] workshop (slides [here]({% link assets/talks/places_2023.pdf %})), whose [open-access
proceedings are available
online](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/content.cgi?PLACES2023).
