I've added a new [astrophotography section]({% link
astrophotography.md %}) to this site with the most significant
astrophotos I take. The idea is to keep track of the progress I make
in this challenging but extremely rewarding hobby. Note that high
resolution versions of the photos are *not* available from this
site, but feel free to mail me if you'd like to have one.
