{% include links.md %}

The paper [**Probabilistic Analysis of Binary
Sessions**](publications.html#InversoMelgrattiPadovaniTrubianiTuosto20),
written with Omar Inverso, Hern√°n Melgratti, Catia Trubiani and
Emilio Tuosto has been accepted to [CONCUR 2020]. There we study a
refinement of session types related to a family of *discrete-time
Markov chains* that enables the reasoning on the probability of
successful session termination.
