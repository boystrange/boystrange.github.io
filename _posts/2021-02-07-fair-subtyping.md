Luca Ciccone and I have been working for some time on proof systems
for **fair subtyping** and other liveness properties of dependent
session types using [generalized inference
systems](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_2), which are
inference systems enriched with **corules**. You can see the Agda
formalization of these proof systems [on
GitHub](https://github.com/boystrange/FairSubtypingAgda).
