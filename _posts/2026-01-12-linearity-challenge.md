title:  "Context-free Session Types Formalized!"
---

I have completed the formalization of
[FreeCP](https://github.com/boystrange/LinearityChallenge/tree/main/freecp),
a session calculus based on classical linear logic akin to CP but
with support for *context-free session* types and *polymorphic
recursion*. The formalization includes a bisimulation-based notion
of context-free session type equivalence as well as proofs of
subject reduction, *deadlock freedom* and strong termination.
