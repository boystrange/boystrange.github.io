title:  "Context-free Session Types Formalized!"
---

I have completed the [formalization in Agda of
FreeCP](https://github.com/boystrange/LinearityChallenge/tree/main/freecp),
a session calculus based on classical linear logic akin to CP but
with support for *context-free session* types and *polymorphic
recursion*. The formalization includes a bisimulation-based
equivalence relation for polymorphic session types as well as proofs
of subject reduction, deadlock freedom and strong termination.
