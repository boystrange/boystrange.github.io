{% include links.md %}

The paper [**Fair Termination of Binary
Sessions**](#CicconePadovani22), written with Luca Ciccone, has been
accepted at the *49<sup>th</sup> annual Symposium on Principles of
Programming Languages* ([POPL 2022]). In this work we study a type
system that ensures the **termination** of binary sessions under
strong fairness assumptions. The type system is the first using
[**fair subtyping**](#Padovani13B), a liveness-preserving refinement
of the classical subtyping relation for session types that has been
studied extensively in the last years but was never applied in a
type system. [FairCheck] is a proof-of-concept implementation of the
type system described in the paper.
