This year I taught the lab sessions of my [course on functional
programming]({% link teaching.md %}) online. I prepared some lecture
notes mixing *cards* (small pages focusing on a single Haskell
feature) and *case studies* (large exercises solving a programming
problem). The final version of the notes is [publicly available on
GitHub](https://boystrange.github.io/LPP/). Thanks to all the
students who provided feedback and notified me of errors.
